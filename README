Panache is a Javascript object-orientation framework. It provides methods to create classes with
public, private and protected members and full inheritance.

Classes are defined as follows:
  
  const SomeClass = new Class({
    
    priv: {
      propertyName: initial_value,
      methodName: function,
      ...
    },
    
    prot: {
      propertyName: initial_value,
      methodName: function,
      ...
    },
    
    pub: {
      propertyName: initial_value,
      methodName: function,
      ...
    },
    
    propertyName: initial_value,
    methodName: function,
    ...
    
    init: function,
    
    events: [
      "eventName", ...
    ]
  });
 
  var sc = new SomeClass(...);

Subclasses are defined similarly,
  
  const ChildClass = new SomeClass.subclass({
    ...
  });
  
Where the definition is in the same form as above.
